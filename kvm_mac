I get the same problem i did in few step :
1 - run your vm
2 - download clover configurator https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/
3 - open clover configurator choose efi partition of your os(for me apple) between 200 and 256 Mb
4- Edit the the file config.plist in folder CLOVER in your partition efi, change GUI resolution for me that was 1280x 720 so i change to 1920x1080


bash virtio.sh run the application
